The way we do this is by treating all input data as unstructured, and using large language models to distill the meaning of each column.\n","\n","\n","Shaped doesn't require much data to work. At a minimum we need to know the `user_id`, `item_id`, `label`, and `created_at` columns of the interactions table. If the `users` and `items` tables are provided then the only requirement is their respective id columns are aliased to `user_id` and `item_id`.\n","\n","To keep things simple, in this tutorial we will focus on the interaction data only (i.e., `events_df`). All 3 existing columns are relevant:\n","- `user_id`: Is the reader who is rating the book. The ID value is contiguous, which ranges from 1 to 53424.\n","- `book_id`: Is a unique identification for a book. The ID value is contiguous, which ranges from 1 to 10000. It will be used as an item to train our models.\n","- `ratings`: Is the rating of a book given by a reader, which ranges from 1 to 5.\n","\n","Besides the above 3 columns, shaped also requires the interaction data to have `created_at` column, which is missing from the given data.
